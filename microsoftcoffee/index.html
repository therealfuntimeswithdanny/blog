                I’ve been carrying the secret for 25 years. Today, I’m coming clean. This is the untold true story of a corporate April Fools prank gone wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                Exactly 25 years ago today, some Microsoft coworkers and I launched a complex and costly prank. We printed up hundreds of realistic shrink-wrapped boxes of a fake product, “Microsoft Coffee”, and snuck it into stores all around the greater Seattle area. Customers were amused, retail was confused, and the local news and tech media covered the prank. Until Microsoft’s PR flacks freaked out, and covered it all up. They scooped up all remaining boxes, denied Microsoft did the prank, downplayed the scale of it to the media, and imposed a ban on real-world pranks which largely remains to this day , ensuring all pranks from then on would need to go through them, as virtual press releases.
            </p>

            <p>
                So when my coworkers and I decided to pull a traditional April Fools tech prank, we thought it would be fun to poke fun at that reputation. Sun Microsystems had just come out with Java, we thought “Microsoft Coffee” sounded like a pale, tepid name for a me-too product.
            </p>
            <p>But two things made our prank different from other pranks from tech companies.
<br><br>
First, instead of just sending out a press release about a goofy fake product, we wanted to make a physical product. Something someone could hold in their hand, and ideally that someone on TV news would hold in front of the camera. (With Starbucks becoming a national brand, we might confuse local media into thinking Microsoft was actually making a coffee-related product; that coincidence helped us, because local news didn’t really know what Java was.)
<br><br>
And second, unlike other pranks our prank didn’t just promote the company, and say ‘Microsoft is successful, but goofy’. Instead, it fed on the idea that Microsoft kind of sucked as a company in some way; a lazy copycat. These two differences would lead to trouble, but we didn’t foresee that.</p>
