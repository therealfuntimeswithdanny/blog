				<h2>My New Best Friend</h2>
			</div>
            <p>
                 Hey there! It feels great to switch things up every now and then, right?  For the past couple of weeks, I've been using my Raspberry Pi 4 as my main computer. It's been a fun little experiment! I've been making changes to my website through GitHub and VS Code using this tiny device. Plus, with my Microsoft 365 subscription, I can still send emails, edit Word documents, and create PowerPoints without any hiccups. Pretty neat, huh?
<br><br>
  Now, don't get me wrong, Raspberry Pi's aren't exactly the best when it comes to being your primary computer. They do a decent job, but they're really in their element as a home server.
<br><br>
 I've installed CasaOS, which is a super clean and user-friendly Docker dashboard that runs on Linux. It's got such a nice interface that makes everything easy to navigate.
<br><br>
 Here's a rundown of the Docker images I downloaded: 
<br><br>
<b>- **Uptime Kuma**:</b> This is an awesome open-source and free self-hosted monitoring tool. It lets you keep an eye on your infrastructure and servers to make sure there's no downtime. 
<br><br>
<b>- **Nginx**:</b> It's a powerful, open-source web server known for its high performance, stability, and flexibility. 
<br><br>
<b>- **Cloudflared**:</b> Cloudflared Tunnel is part of Cloudflare Zero Trust. Itâ€™s a great way to securely connect your networks, applications, or devices to Cloudflare without exposing them directly to the internet.
<br><br>
<b> - **Navidrome**:</b> This is an open-source music server that allows you to stream your digital music collection from anywhere. Perfect for music lovers! 
<br><br>
Honestly, the Pi 4 is one of the best cheap computers if you're looking to set up a home server. 
<br><br>
I do still use the Pi sometimes, especially when the power goes out or when my main computer is updating. It's always handy to have a backup, right? So, that's been my little tech adventure lately. Have you ever tried using a Raspberry Pi for anything? I'd love to hear about your experiences!  Comment them down below ðŸ‘‡
